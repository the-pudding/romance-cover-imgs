{"title":"What does a happily ever after look like?","intro":[{"type":"text","value":"Girl meets book, girl checks out the book cover. Girl reads book, and they live happily ever after. The “happily ever after” is what makes a romance novel — the promise that love will work out in the end. My relationship with romance novels is perhaps a “slow burn” trope. It started with a slight obsession of The Princess Diaries series and Sarah Dessen books in middle school."},{"type":"text","value":"We had a cooling off period during which I considered myself too serious to read such things, another period during which I considered them too shameful to align with my beliefs. Despite making up almost a quarter of the adult fiction market, the genre’s perception in the broader public imagination has often been negative, a view that seeped into my own. This was the beginning of our mini enemies-to-lovers arc."}],"postIntro":[{"type":"text","value":"Over the last few years, romance made its way back to my consciousness, both with love saturating my real life and a desire for escapist hope in the bleak pandemic months. I’ve discovered many romance plots that reflect twenty- and thirty-something women navigating career choices, friendship, and sexuality. More books featuring more protagonists of color, navigating their experiences and finding joy at the end of it all, painted fuller possibilities for my life."},{"type":"text","value":"This trend of approachability has been most clear to me than in the changes in romance novels’ cover art. What comes to mind when imagining the archetypical romance novel might be either a scantily clad Fabio clutching a fainting lady, or a colorful pop illustration with big block text."},{"type":"text","value":"How did we get from one to the other? We looked at over 1,300 covers featured by Publishers Weekly from 2011 to 2023 to find out. The titles were chosen as highlights in a semi-annual listing from a major voice in publishing, reflecting the industry’s changing view of romance. We matched each title to its cover and evaluated each for its raunchiness, art style, and representation of racial diversity, trends of which we explore below.

This was known as “the clinch”, which had its peak in the 1970s and 1980s. The long haired Fabio — who has graced over 400 covers — holding his tragic maiden might be what appears in the popular imagination of the romance novel to this day. At one time, Harlequin even gave readers fake covers with which one could hide their true reading material.[1]"},{"type":"text","value":"Throughout the course of the twentieth century, romance covers reflected women’s place in society, and love stories as a reflection of it. In the 50s when many more women joined the workforce, corporate romance and doctor-nurse covers were popular. In the 60s, with the rise of commercial plane travel, covers were set abroad with highly exoticized characters. In the 70s and 80s, clinch covers represented an era of more feminist openness in women’s sexual desire, versus puritan social forces, juxtaposed in the social eye."}]}
